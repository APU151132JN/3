/*
        Test if the canting at the end of a nanowire corresponds to the 1D analytical
        result if open boundary conditions are used. This test is similar to the
        standard test proposed in arXiv:1803.11174

        If the nanowire consists only out of one row of cells, the analytical canting
        matches with the simulated canting if open (or periodic) boundary conditions are
        used. The Neumann BC yields a different canting.

        This does not mean that Neumann BC are wrong. To be more precise, the analytical
        result, as well as the numerical results obtained with open and Neumann BC are
        slightly wrong because the width of the nanowire is not taken into account
        properly.
